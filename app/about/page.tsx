          Futurama is an American animated science fiction sitcom created by
          Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company and later revived by
          Comedy Central, and then Hulu. The series follows Philip J. Fry, a
          young man who is cryogenically preserved for 1,000 years and revived
          on December 31, 2999. Fry finds work at the interplanetary delivery
          company Planet Express, working alongside the one-eyed mutant Leela
          and the robot Bender. The series was envisioned by Groening in the
          mid-1990s while working on The Simpsons; he brought David X. Cohen
          aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.
