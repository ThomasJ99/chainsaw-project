              Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished teenager
              who makes a contract that fuses his body with that of Pochita, the
              dog-like Chainsaw Devil, granting him the ability to transform
              parts of his body into chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the
              Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on
              combating Devils whenever they become a threat to Japan. The
              second arc of the story focuses on Asa Mitaka, a high school
              student who enters into a contract with Yoru, the War Devil, who
              forces her to hunt down Chainsaw Man in order to reclaim what he
              had stolen from her.
