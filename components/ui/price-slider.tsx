// What is my sliders role before I start implementing it?
// My getProducts holds the min/max price, so its job should be to render correctly in the URL by making sure the URL is correct
// My slider should then have some hook for interactivity and update the url params on submit button
// Perhaps ill have two sliders which each determine min/max with a input field which shows the current value for each slider
